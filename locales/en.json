The idea of the game is to compete one-on-one or in groups, complete challenges, and score points for your respective team. A points and dice system, including a game board, already exists.\nWhat’s missing? The games themselves – and that’s where we need you! Any idea is welcome, whether it’s balancing bottles on your forehead, reciting the alphabet backwards, or – with the utmost seriousness – skillfully sending a paper airplane into your opponent’s open fly. Anything fun and creative has a place on the game cards.\n\nSo grab a card, give your game idea a name, describe the challenge, and at the same time send greetings to the bride and groom, who will receive a unique, interactive gift from the entire wedding party.\n\nBest regards,\nLeander and Lukas"
